# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
### The company wants to use machine learning to predict credit risk. That supervised machine learning will provide to a bteer accurate identification of loans and rates.

### the analysis to using to compare the strength and weaknesses. This is the process to build and evaluate the data nad predict credit risk.

## Results
### I was to created the machine learning to test and analyze for sample and ensemble.
## Sampling
### * Balance score for all models is low ranging from 50% to 65%
### * SMOTE and ClusterCentroidsfor low risk customers with accurate results estimate 7700 and compare with more than 10,000 on the other two models. 
### * The precision scores for All models are smiliar or so close amount of high risk and low risk for PRE, REC, and SPE in average total.
## Ensemble
### * The confusion Matrix results predict EasyEnesmbleClassifer high 21% than BalancedRandomForestClassifer.
### * BalanceRandom Has 79% of balance accurary and EasyEnesmble has 93% of balance accurary.
### * the Precision Scores F1, GEO, and IBA are the better EasyEnsesmbe than BalanceRandom.
## Summary
### All the Balance Accurary score are more than 50%, but except Ensemble 93% and 79% are high which is show good predict with estimate for credit risk and customers.
